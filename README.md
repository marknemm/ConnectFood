# FoodWeb

A hybrid app that has the purpose of minimizing food waste within the community by automating & facilitating food donations.<br>
It is comprised of 3 core node projects:

  - **Client**: Located under **/client**. This is a front-end **Angular** monorepo. View its [README.md](https://github.com/marknemm/FoodWeb/blob/master/client/README.md) for more details.
  - **Server**: Located under **/server**. This is a back-end **TS Node** monorepo. View its [README.md](https://github.com/marknemm/FoodWeb/blob/master/server/README.md) for more details.
  - **Shared**: Located under **/shared**. This consists of **Typescript** source that is shared between Client & Server.

## Setup Methods

There are 3 possible setup methods. It is recommended that you proceed with the **Docker Setup** method.

Concerning the generation of API keys, you may either ask the FoodWeb team for a private key, or you may generate your own. **Ensure that you do not disclose these API keys to the public!**



### Docker Setup

This is the simplest setup. If using **Windows 10 Home Edition** Refer to the **Docker Toolbox Setup** section.

#### Required Downloads:

  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

#### Directions:

  1. In Docker Settings under Resources -> File Sharing, ensure that you enable sharing of the **C drive**.
  2. In Docker Settings under Resources -> Advanced, increase the number of CPUs and amount of memory as you see fit.
  2. Pull/Build all docker images and spin-up all containers via: `docker-compose up -d foodweb`.
  3. Update the generated **/server/projects/web/.env** file by setting the following variables to valid API keys:
      - **DISTANCE_TIME_API_KEY**
      - **DIRECTIONS_API_KEY**
      - **GEOCODER_API_KEY**
  4. Start developing!



### Docker Toolbox Setup

This is a legacy setup for **Windows 10 Home Edition** users. It is recommended that you either upgrade to Windows 10 Pro Edition or dual boot your machine with a Linux distribution to avoid performance and usage pitfalls of Docker Toolbox.

#### Required Downloads:

  - [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
  
#### Directions:

  1. After booting up Docker Toolbox, open up **Oracle Virtual Box**, find the running VM that is likely named *default*. Stop the VM, and open its settings.
  2. Under System settings, increase the Base Memory to at least **4096 MB**, and preferrably to **8192 MB**.
  3. Switch to the Processor tab, and maximize the number of processors to the highest 'green value'. Hit Ok to confirm the settings.
  4. Restart Docker Toolbox, and show the terminal for rebooted VM.
  5. Enter the following command to increase the number of code change watchers allowed: `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.
  6. Pull/Build all docker images and spin-up all containers via: `docker-compose up -d foodweb`.
  7. Update the generated **/server/projects/web/.env** file by setting the following variables to valid API keys:
      - **DISTANCE_TIME_API_KEY**
      - **DIRECTIONS_API_KEY**
      - **GEOCODER_API_KEY**
  8. Start developing!


### Local Setup

#### Required Downloads:

  - [Postgresql Server](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) v11.6
  - PostGIS Extension - Available at end of Postgresql Server install
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/download) v5.x
  - [Fake SMTP Server](https://github.com/ReachFive/fake-smtp-server) - `npm install -g fake-smtp-server`

#### Directions:

  1. Within the */server* directory, run `npm run dotenv:generate` and `npm run admin:dotenv:generate` to generate the starter **.env** files for each back-end project.
  2. Edit the generated **/server/projects/\*\*/.env** files by changing the following hostnames to **localhost**:
      - **foodweb**
      - **postgres**
      - **redis**
  3. Update the generated **/server/projects/\*\*/.env** files by setting the following variables to valid API keys:
      - **DISTANCE_TIME_API_KEY**
      - **DIRECTIONS_API_KEY**
      - **GEOCODER_API_KEY**
  4. Start the Postgresql Server if not already started.
  5. Start the Redis Server if not already started.
  6. Start the Fake SMTP Server via CLI: `fake-smtp-server`.
  7. Within the /server directory, run `npm run pg:initialize` to initialize development data within your local postgres database.
  8. Run `npm start` to start both the /server and /client portions of FoodWeb.
  9. Start developing!


## Recommended VS Code Extensions
