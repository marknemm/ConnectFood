    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
    you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
    collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
    As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
    inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

  <p class="strong-underline">Verification process</p>

  <p>
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
    in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have
    previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that
    we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
    (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
    we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
    information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and
    for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

    <li>
      you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties.
