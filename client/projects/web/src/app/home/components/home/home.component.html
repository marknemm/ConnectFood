      <mat-card-content>
        Most organizations that target food insecurity do so through donations run by word-of-mouth, rely on long standing relationships, and plan deliveries months in advanced.
        Through the use of technology, we hope to make the process of donating food quick, easy and accessible to anyone.

        <ol class="op-list">
          <li>Donating organizations upload a description of their donation.</li>
          <li>Our system automatically finds a local charity as a recipient.</li>
          <li>The charity confirms that they wish to receive the donation.</li>

          Donors are protected from liability through the <i>Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</i> and can claim deductions based on the amount of food they donate.
          FoodWeb and our community-based drivers do our best to ensure prompt and safe transportation of food so that it remains safe to eat.
